Launches a server that tells you when to work out!

You'll need to run the queries in schema.sql to set up the schema that it uses to record the workouts people have done.

Set the environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` to whatever gets to your db (defaults to trying to connect with localhost/root/empty pass).

Set the environment variable PORT and run `node server.js` to launch the server.
